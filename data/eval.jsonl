{"instruction": "Explain what a large language model is to a junior backend engineer who has only used APIs like ChatGPT.", "input": "", "output": "A large language model (LLM) is a neural network trained on massive amounts of text to predict the next token in a sequence. Internally, it's just math—matrix multiplications and nonlinear functions—but at scale it learns patterns in language: grammar, facts, code structures, and common reasoning templates. When you call an LLM API, you send text, it transforms that text into numeric vectors, runs them through many transformer layers, and then samples the most likely next tokens. The result feels conversational, but under the hood it’s just repeated pattern completion at high speed."}
{"instruction": "How would you explain the difference between pretraining and fine-tuning to a non-technical product manager?", "input": "", "output": "You can think of pretraining as sending a model to school and fine-tuning as on-the-job training.\n\n• Pretraining: The model reads a huge amount of text—books, articles, websites—and learns general language skills: how sentences work, common facts, and how people express ideas.\n\n• Fine-tuning: After school, we give the model a more specific job, like 'act as a support agent' or 'explain programming concepts to beginners'. We feed it examples of that job so it can specialize.\n\nPretraining makes the model broadly knowledgeable. Fine-tuning nudges it toward a particular role or style."}
{"instruction": "Describe, in a structured way, how a transformer processes a single input sentence from tokens to output.", "input": "", "output": "Here’s the high-level flow of how a transformer processes a sentence:\n\n1. Tokenization\n   • The input text is split into tokens (subword units like 'trans', 'former', '##s').\n   • Each token is mapped to an integer ID.\n\n2. Embedding\n   • Each token ID is converted into a dense vector via an embedding matrix.\n   • Positional information is added (via positional encodings or rotary embeddings).\n\n3. Stacked transformer blocks\n   For each block:\n   a) Self-attention\n      • Input vectors are mapped to Queries, Keys, and Values using q_proj, k_proj, and v_proj.\n      • Attention scores are computed to determine how much each token should look at others.\n      • Values are combined based on these scores to produce updated representations.\n   b) Feed-forward network (FFN)\n      • Each token’s vector passes through a small MLP that expands and then compresses the dimension.\n      • Nonlinear activations give the network more expressive power.\n   c) Residual + normalization\n      • Residual connections and layer norm stabilize training and information flow.\n\n4. Output layer\n   • The final hidden states go through a projection to vocabulary logits.\n   • Softmax turns logits into probabilities for the next token.\n\nThe model repeats this next-token prediction step autoregressively to generate sequences."}
{"instruction": "Compare overfitting and underfitting for a small fine-tuned LLM, and give one concrete sign of each during training.", "input": "", "output": "Overfitting and underfitting describe two opposite failure modes:\n\n• Underfitting: The model is too simple or not trained enough.\n  – Behavior: It fails to capture patterns in your fine-tuning data.\n  – Sign: Both training loss and validation loss are high and stay high. Outputs are vague or generic even for training prompts.\n\n• Overfitting: The model memorizes your fine-tuning data instead of generalizing.\n  – Behavior: It performs extremely well on training examples but poorly on new prompts.\n  – Sign: Training loss keeps dropping while validation loss stops improving or gets worse.\n\nFor a small fine-tuned LLM, underfitting feels like 'the LoRA doesn’t do anything', while overfitting feels like 'the LoRA only works on the exact examples I fed it'."}
{"instruction": "Explain, to a new ML engineer, why we often freeze the base model when using LoRA instead of updating all weights.", "input": "", "output": "We freeze the base model in LoRA for three main reasons:\n\n1. Memory and compute savings\n   • Updating all weights in a large model requires storing gradients and optimizer state for billions of parameters.\n   • This doesn’t fit on small GPUs and is expensive even on large ones.\n   • LoRA only adds and trains a tiny set of low-rank matrices, so the optimizer state is tiny.\n\n2. Stability and safety\n   • The base model already captures a lot of useful knowledge.\n   • Freezing it reduces the risk of 'unlearning' or destabilizing that knowledge.\n   • LoRA acts like an add-on, gently steering behavior without rewriting the whole brain.\n\n3. Modularity\n   • A frozen base can support many different LoRAs (styles, domains, personas).\n   • You get reusable building blocks instead of cloning full models for every variant.\n\nSo freezing the base model is both a practical engineering choice and a way to keep the original capabilities intact."}
{"instruction": "How would you explain self-attention using a code review analogy for a software engineer?", "input": "", "output": "Imagine each token in a sentence is a line of code in a pull request, and self-attention is the review process.\n\n• Query (Q): For each line, you ask, 'Which other lines do I need to look at to understand this one?'\n• Key (K): Each line advertises what it contains—its variables, logic, and context.\n• Value (V): If you decide a line is relevant, the Value is the actual information you pull from it.\n\nSelf-attention computes how strongly each line (token) should 'review' or reference other lines based on Query–Key similarity. Then it aggregates information from all relevant lines via the Values.\n\nEnd result: Each token’s representation becomes informed by exactly the parts of the sequence it needs, similar to how you understand a code change by cross-referencing connected lines and functions."}
{"instruction": "Explain what an embedding is, and then give an example of how an embedding space might organize programming concepts.", "input": "", "output": "An embedding is a vector representation of an object—in our case, a piece of text—such that similar objects are close together in a high-dimensional space.\n\nIn an embedding space for programming concepts, you might see:\n\n• 'for loop', 'while loop', and 'iteration' clustered near each other.\n• 'Recursion' close to 'call stack' and 'tree traversal'.\n• 'SQL query' near 'database', 'JOIN', and 'index'.\n\nThe model learns these relationships automatically from data. When we use embeddings, we exploit this structure: if 'binary search' and 'logarithmic time' are nearby, the model has captured that they’re related concepts."}
{"instruction": "Explain, step by step, how a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system answers a user’s question about Kubernetes.", "input": "", "output": "Here’s a typical flow for a RAG system answering a Kubernetes question:\n\n1. User query\n   • The user asks: \"How do I safely roll out a deployment in Kubernetes?\"\n\n2. Query embedding\n   • The RAG system sends the question to an embedding model.\n   • The embedding model converts the text into a vector representing its meaning.\n\n3. Retrieval from a vector store\n   • The system searches a vector database of Kubernetes docs, blog posts, and guides.\n   • It finds the documents whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding.\n\n4. Context assembly\n   • The top-k retrieved chunks are merged into a context block.\n   • This might include documentation on Deployments, rolling updates, and health checks.\n\n5. Prompt construction\n   • The RAG system builds a prompt for the LLM: system instructions + the user’s question + the retrieved context.\n\n6. LLM generation\n   • The LLM reads the prompt and generates an answer that cites or paraphrases the retrieved content.\n\n7. Optional post-processing\n   • The system may format the answer, add references, or apply safety filters.\n\nThe key idea: instead of relying on the LLM’s memory, RAG fetches relevant documents at query time and lets the model ground its answer in that external knowledge."}
{"instruction": "How would you describe quantization to an engineer who is worried about losing too much model quality?", "input": "", "output": "Quantization trades numerical precision for efficiency, but it doesn’t have to wreck quality if done carefully.\n\n• What it does:\n  – Stores weights in fewer bits (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit instead of 16/32-bit).\n  – Reduces memory usage and often speeds up inference.\n\n• Why quality can be preserved:\n  – Modern quantization schemes focus on preserving the most important ranges and structures of weights.\n  – 8-bit quantization often has almost no visible impact on many tasks.\n  – For more aggressive 4-bit setups, using good calibration data and modern methods keeps degradation small.\n\n• Practical reality:\n  – For many production workloads, the trade-off is worth it: slightly lower ceiling accuracy for much cheaper, faster serving.\n\nSo the goal isn’t 'perfect precision'; it’s 'good enough quality at a much better cost profile'."}
{"instruction": "Explain, with a simple mental model, why attention scales quadratically with sequence length.", "input": "", "output": "In self-attention, each token compares itself to every other token.\n\nIf you have:\n• N tokens,\n• Each token needs to compute attention scores with N tokens,\n\nthen the total comparisons is roughly N × N = N².\n\nMental model: Imagine a room where every person must introduce themselves to every other person. If there are 10 people, there are about 100 introductions. If there are 1,000 people, you suddenly have around 1,000,000 introductions. That explosive growth is the quadratic scaling that makes very long context windows expensive."}
{"instruction": "A junior engineer asks: \"Why can't we just train everything with full fine-tuning instead of using LoRA?\" Answer them in a friendly, detailed way.", "input": "", "output": "Great question—full fine-tuning sounds simpler on paper, but it runs into practical walls:\n\n1. Hardware limits\n   • Full fine-tuning updates every parameter in a huge model.\n   • That means you need memory not just for the weights, but also gradients and optimizer states for billions of parameters.\n   • This often requires very large GPUs (40–80GB+), which are expensive and not accessible to most teams.\n\n2. Cost and time\n   • Full fine-tuning is slow and costly, especially when you experiment with multiple datasets or tasks.\n   • LoRA lets you run many more experiments because each run is cheaper.\n\n3. Risk of damaging base behavior\n   • A fully fine-tuned model can drift far from its original behavior and lose useful general knowledge.\n   • LoRA keeps the base frozen and adds a small steering layer, reducing the chance of catastrophic forgetting.\n\n4. Modularity and reuse\n   • With LoRA, one base model can support many adapters: different styles, domains, or personas.\n   • You only store small LoRA files instead of duplicating whole models for each variant.\n\nSo full fine-tuning still has its place, but LoRA is a more resource-friendly and flexible tool for many real-world use cases."}
{"instruction": "Explain Adam optimizer to someone who understands gradients but has only used vanilla SGD.", "input": "", "output": "If SGD is 'update weights in the direction of the gradient with a fixed step size', Adam is 'SGD with per-parameter adaptive step sizes and built-in momentum'.\n\nAdam keeps two moving averages for each parameter:\n\n1. m (first moment): an exponential moving average of gradients.\n   • This is like momentum—it smooths gradients over time.\n\n2. v (second moment): an exponential moving average of squared gradients.\n   • This captures how large gradients tend to be.\n\nThe update uses m / (sqrt(v) + ε), so parameters with consistently large gradients get smaller effective learning rates, and parameters with small gradients get relatively larger steps.\n\nIn practice, Adam:\n• Requires less manual tuning of the learning rate schedule.\n• Converges faster or more reliably on many deep learning problems.\n\nThat’s why it’s the default optimizer in much of modern ML, especially for large models."}
{"instruction": "Describe, with structure, what you would log when running your first LoRA experiment.", "input": "", "output": "For a first LoRA experiment, I’d log:\n\n1. Configuration\n   • Base model name and version.\n   • LoRA settings: rank, alpha, target modules, dropout.\n   • Optimizer and learning rate schedule.\n   • Batch size, max sequence length, number of epochs.\n\n2. Dataset details\n   • Dataset name and version (e.g., 'ml_sensei_v1').\n   • Number of training and eval examples.\n   • Brief description of the task and style.\n\n3. Training metrics\n   • Training loss per step or per epoch.\n   • Validation loss at checkpoints.\n   • Any secondary metrics if added later.\n\n4. Qualitative outputs\n   • A few fixed eval prompts.\n   • Side-by-side base vs LoRA responses at key checkpoints.\n\n5. Environment info\n   • GPU type, VRAM.\n   • Library versions (transformers, peft, torch).\n\nThis level of logging makes it much easier to reproduce runs, debug issues, and write a clear experiment summary later."}
{"instruction": "How would you explain the idea of \"embedding similarity\" to someone familiar with vectors in linear algebra?", "input": "", "output": "Embedding similarity is just 'how aligned two vectors are' applied to meaning.\n\n• We map texts (words, sentences, docs) into vectors in ℝ^d.\n• Then we use measures like cosine similarity to assess how close they are in direction.\n\nIf two texts are semantically related, their embedding vectors tend to have a high cosine similarity (small angle between them). If they’re unrelated, the angle is larger and cosine similarity drops.\n\nSo all the usual intuition from linear algebra—angles, norms, dot products—directly transfers to reasoning about semantic similarity in embedding spaces."}
{"instruction": "Explain, with a concrete example, how few-shot prompting differs from fine-tuning.", "input": "", "output": "Few-shot prompting and fine-tuning both teach the model patterns, but in different ways.\n\n• Few-shot prompting\n  – You include a handful of input–output examples directly in the prompt.\n  – The model uses them on the fly to infer the pattern.\n  – Example: You show 3 examples of converting English to SQL, then provide a 4th natural-language query and ask for SQL.\n  – No model weights change; it’s all in-context.\n\n• Fine-tuning\n  – You train the model on many input–output pairs so its weights adapt to that task.\n  – The pattern becomes part of the model’s parameters.\n  – After fine-tuning, you can ask for English-to-SQL with a much simpler prompt.\n\nAnalogy: Few-shot prompting is like giving a contractor a sketch every time you ask for a drawing. Fine-tuning is like training them in your house style so they draw that way by default."}
{"instruction": "A teammate asks why their RAG system sometimes \"hallucinates\" even with retrieval. Give them a detailed explanation and one mitigation.", "input": "", "output": "RAG reduces hallucinations but doesn’t eliminate them because the LLM still ultimately generates text based on patterns.\n\nReasons hallucinations can still occur:\n\n1. Poor retrieval\n   • The retrieved chunks might be irrelevant or only loosely related, leaving the model to guess.\n\n2. Weak grounding in the prompt\n   • If the prompt doesn’t clearly instruct the model to base its answer only on provided context, it may blend context with prior knowledge or speculation.\n\n3. Model behavior\n   • LLMs are trained to be helpful and coherent, not strictly truthful. When unsure, they may confidently invent details.\n\nOne mitigation:\n\n• Add strict grounding instructions + citation requirement.\n  – Tell the model: \"Use only the context below. If the answer is not covered, say you don’t know.\" \n  – Ask it to reference specific chunks or quotes.\n\nCombined with better retrieval (more relevant chunks) and possibly a post-check step, this significantly lowers hallucination rates."}
{"instruction": "Explain what a \"hidden dimension\" is and how changing it affects a transformer model.", "input": "", "output": "The hidden dimension is the size of the internal vectors representing each token at each layer—for example, 1024 or 4096.\n\nEffect of changing it:\n\n• Increasing hidden dimension\n  – Each token’s representation can capture more features and nuances.\n  – Parameter count, memory use, and compute all increase.\n  – Can improve model capacity and performance if trained well.\n\n• Decreasing hidden dimension\n  – Reduces compute and memory footprint.\n  – Limits how much information the model can encode per token.\n\nIt’s one of the key knobs in transformer architecture design, and it interacts with depth (number of layers) and number of attention heads."}
{"instruction": "You’re mentoring a junior dev who keeps mixing up parameters and hyperparameters. Clarify the difference with examples.", "input": "", "output": "Here’s a simple way to keep them straight:\n\n• Parameters\n  – Learned by the model during training.\n  – Examples: weights in attention projections, biases in feed-forward layers, embedding vectors.\n  – The training loop updates these automatically based on gradients.\n\n• Hyperparameters\n  – Chosen by you before training; not learned automatically.\n  – Examples: learning rate, batch size, number of layers, LoRA rank, max sequence length.\n  – You tune these via experiments.\n\nSo if it changes because the optimizer updates it, it’s a parameter. If you have to pick it in a config file, it’s a hyperparameter."}
{"instruction": "Explain, to someone new to PyTorch, what a \"forward pass\" and \"backward pass\" are in training.", "input": "", "output": "In training, each iteration has two main phases:\n\n1. Forward pass\n   • You feed a batch of inputs into the model.\n   • The model runs its layers and produces outputs (e.g., logits for next tokens).\n   • You compute a loss that measures how wrong those outputs are compared to the labels.\n\n2. Backward pass\n   • You call `.backward()` on the loss.\n   • PyTorch automatically computes gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter using the computation graph from the forward pass.\n   • The optimizer then uses these gradients to update the model’s parameters.\n\nThink of the forward pass as 'making predictions and scoring them' and the backward pass as 'figuring out how to adjust the knobs so we do better next time'."}
{"instruction": "Ask the model to walk through the lifecycle of a fine-tuning project, from problem definition to publishing the LoRA.", "input": "", "output": "A typical fine-tuning project with LoRA might look like this:\n\n1. Problem definition\n   • Clarify what you want: e.g., \"make explanations more structured for beginner ML learners\".\n   • Decide on success criteria: better clarity, fewer hallucinations, consistent style.\n\n2. Data collection and curation\n   • Gather or author high-quality instruction–response pairs.\n   • Make formatting consistent (JSONL, clear instructions, good outputs).\n   • Split into train and eval sets.\n\n3. Model and config selection\n   • Choose a base model (e.g., a small chat LLM).\n   • Set LoRA hyperparameters: rank, alpha, target modules.\n   • Pick training hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, epochs.\n\n4. Prototyping\n   • Run a small training job on a subset of data.\n   • Check that training runs, losses decrease, and outputs change as expected.\n\n5. Full training\n   • Train on the full dataset with monitoring.\n   • Save checkpoints and log metrics.\n\n6. Evaluation\n   • Run side-by-side comparisons on a fixed eval set.\n   • Have humans review outputs for clarity, correctness, and style.\n\n7. Packaging and documentation\n   • Save the LoRA adapter and push it to a hub (e.g., Hugging Face).\n   • Write a README or model card documenting base model, data, usage, and limitations.\n\n8. Integration\n   • Wire the LoRA into your app or notebook workflows.\n   • Optionally, iterate with a new version based on feedback.\n\nThis lifecycle turns 'I want a custom LLM behavior' into a reproducible, documented artifact you can share and reuse."}
{"instruction": "Explain why logging qualitative examples (not just loss) is important when evaluating a style LoRA.", "input": "", "output": "Loss tells you how well the model matches the training targets on average, but it doesn’t fully capture *how* the model is writing.\n\nFor a style LoRA, you care about:\n• Tone (friendly, formal, playful).\n• Structure (headings, bullet points, step-by-step explanations).\n• Audience alignment (beginner vs expert).\n\nThese are hard to summarize with a single scalar metric.\n\nLogging qualitative examples—like a fixed set of prompts with base vs LoRA outputs—lets you:\n• Visually inspect whether the style is shifting in the intended way.\n• Catch regressions where loss improves but usability drops.\n• Build compelling before/after examples for documentation and your portfolio.\n\nSo qualitative examples are the 'user experience lens' to complement numerical metrics."}
{"instruction": "Give a concise but clear explanation of what \"catastrophic forgetting\" is in full fine-tuning and why LoRA helps mitigate it.", "input": "", "output": "Catastrophic forgetting happens when full fine-tuning overwrites a model’s existing knowledge while learning a new task. The model becomes good at the fine-tuned behavior but loses general capabilities it had before.\n\nLoRA mitigates this by:\n• Keeping the base model weights frozen.\n• Storing task-specific changes in small low-rank matrices.\n\nIf the LoRA behaves badly, you can simply remove or swap it. The base model’s knowledge remains intact, so you’re less likely to permanently damage its general abilities."}
{"instruction": "Explain what a vector database is and give an example of how you’d use it in an internal developer tool.", "input": "", "output": "A vector database stores high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and lets you quickly search for the nearest neighbors to a query vector.\n\nIn an internal developer tool, you could:\n• Embed all your engineering docs, ADRs, and runbooks.\n• When a dev asks, \"How do we handle database migrations?\", embed the question.\n• Use the vector DB to find the most relevant docs.\n• Feed those docs into an LLM to generate a concise, context-aware answer.\n\nThe vector database provides semantic search; the LLM provides natural language explanations on top of that search."}
{"instruction": "Describe, at a high level, how model size, data quality, and training compute interact in modern LLM performance.", "input": "", "output": "Modern LLM performance is shaped by a three-way trade-off:\n\n1. Model size\n   • Larger models can represent more complex functions and patterns.\n   • But they’re more expensive to train and serve.\n\n2. Data quality and quantity\n   • High-quality, diverse data lets the model learn useful patterns rather than noise.\n   • Scaling data helps, but poor-quality data can waste capacity and compute.\n\n3. Training compute\n   • You need enough compute to fully train a model of a given size on a given amount of data.\n   • Undertraining a large model can undercut the benefits of its capacity.\n\nScaling laws show that, up to a point, increasing all three in a balanced way improves performance smoothly. Imbalances—like a huge model with little data—tend to be inefficient."}

The first partition z is processed by a series of reversible layers with\n1 2 N 1\nthe same dimension as z until, at some point, z is appended and combined with the\n1 2\nfirst partition.

Even with non\nlinear units in the hidden layer, such a network\nis equivalent to linear principal component anal inputs outputs\nysis. Links representing bias parameters have\nbeen omittedforclarity.\nfor the input variables. However, neural networks have also been applied to un\nsupervised learning where they have been used for dimensionality reduction. This\nis achieved by using a network having the same number ofoutputs as inputs, and\noptimizing the weights so as to minimize some measure ofthe reconstruction error\nbetweeninputs andoutputs withrespectto asetoftrainingdata.\nConsider first a multilayer perceptron ofthe form shown in Figure 12.18, hav\ning D inputs, D output units and M hidden units, with M < D. The targets used\nto train the network are simply the input vectors themselves, so that the network\nis attempting to map each input vector onto itself. Such a network is said to form\nan autoassociative mapping. Since the number ofhidden units is smaller than the\nnumberofinputs, aperfectreconstruction ofall inputvectors is not in general pos\nsible. We therefore determine the network parameters w by minimizing an error\nfunction whichcaptures the degreeofmismatch betweenthe inputvectors and their\nreconstructions. In particular, we shallchooseasum-of-squares erroroftheform\n1LN\nE(w) = \"2 Ily(x n, w) - x n 112 • (12.91)\nn=l\nIf the hidden units have linear activations functions, then it can be shown that the\nerror function has a unique global minimum, and that at this minimum the network\nperformsaprojectionontotheM-dimensionalsubspacewhichisspannedbythefirst\nM principal components ofthe data (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988; Baldi and Hornik,\n1989). Thus, the vectorsofweights whichleadintothe hidden units inFigure 12.18\nform a basis set which spans the principal subspace. Note, however, that these vec\ntors need not be orthogonal or normalized. This result is unsurprising, since both\nprincipalcomponentanalysisandthe neuralnetworkareusinglineardimensionality\nreduction andare minimizing the same sum-of-squareserrorfunction.\nItmightbethoughtthatthelimitationsofalineardimensionalityreductioncould\nbeovercomeby usingnonlinear(sigmoidal)activationfunctions forthehidden units\nin the networkinFigure 12.18. However,evenwith nonlinearhiddenunits, the min\nimum error solution is again given by the projection onto the principal component\nsubspace (Bourlardand Kamp, 1988). Thereis thereforenoadvantageinusingtwo\nlayerneural networks to performdimensionality reduction.

Inbothcases, CoDeGraphfailedtoidentifyconsistent-anomaly\n(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1)\ncommunities as outliers, demonstrating the necessity of coverage-based selection.\nChoice of Community Detection Algorithm\nModularity optimization [49] is a widely adopted approach that partitions graphs\nby maximizing the difference between observed and expected edge weights under\na degree-based null model. The modularity score is given by:\nk k\ni j\nQ = A δ(σ ,σ ),\nij i j\n− 2m\nij (cid:18) (cid:19)\n(cid:88)\nwhere A is the adjacency matrix, k and k are node degrees, m is the total edge\nij i j\nweight, and δ(σ ,σ ) = 1 if nodes i and j are in the same community.\ni j\nHowever, modularity’s dependence on relative node degrees (via expected edge\nweight term k k /2m) is not compatible with our anomaly similarity graph . In\ni j\nG\n, consistent-anomaly communities are expected to exhibit much stronger internal\nG\nconnectivity compared to the rest of the graph. Nonetheless, there still exists some\nweaker links within these communities. When such weak edges fall below the\nexpected weight threshold, modularity penalizes them, even though the overall\ncommunity remains densely connected. As a result, strongly cohesive anomaly\nclusters may be artificially fragmented into smaller subgroups. This fragmentation\nundermines our IQR-based community scoring, diluting the density of anomaly\nclusters and hindering the reliable detection of consistent-anomaly patterns. As\nshown in Figure 3.6 for the metal nut class, the dense community of flip metal\nnut fragments.\nIn contrast, CPM evaluates communities based on an absolute resolution pa-\nrameter γ, independent of degrees, making it better suited for preserving intact\nconsistent-anomaly groups. We set γ to the 25th percentile of edge weights, ensur-\ning connections within anomaly communities exceed this threshold and avoiding\nfragmentation. This leads to more robust detection of outlier communities, en-\nhancing patch filtering and zero-shot segmentation stability.\n55"}

Hence, the Fréchet inception distance approximates both distributions by\nAppendixC.5.4\nmultivariateGaussians and (as the name suggests) estimates the distance betweenthem\nFréchetdistance\nusing the Fréchet distance.\nHowever, it does not model the distance with respect to the original data but rather\ntheactivationsinthedeepestlayeroftheinceptionclassificationnetwork. Thesehidden\nunits are the ones most associated with object classes, so the comparison occurs at a\nsemantic level, ignoring the more fine-grained details of the images. This metric does\ntake account of diversity within classes but relies heavily on the information retained by\nthe features in the inception network; any information discarded by the network does\nnot contribute to the result. Some of this discarded information may still be important\nto generate realistic samples.\nManifold precision/recall: Fréchet inception distance is sensitive both to the realism\nof the samples and their diversity but does not distinguish between these factors. To\ndisentangle these qualities, we consider the overlap between the data manifold (i.e., the\nsubsetofthedataspacewheretherealexampleslie)andthemodelmanifold(i.e.,where\nthe generated samples lie). The precision is the fraction of model samples that fall into\nthedatamanifold. Thismeasurestheproportionofgeneratedsamplesthatarerealistic.\nThe recall is the fraction of data examples that fall within the model manifold. This\nmeasures the proportion of the real data the model can generate (figure 14.5).\nTo estimate the manifold, we place a hypersphere around each data example, whose\nradius is the distance to the kth nearest neighbor. The union of these spheres is an\napproximation of the manifold, and it’s easy to determine if a new point lies within it.\nThis manifold is also typically computed in the feature space of a classifier with the\nadvantages and disadvantages that entails.\n14.4 Summary\nUnsupervised models learn about the structure of a dataset in the absence of labels. A\nsubset of these models is generative and can synthesize new data examples. A further\nsubset is probabilistic in that they can both generate new examples and assign a proba-\nbility to observed data. The models considered in the following four chapters start with\na latent variable z which has a known distribution. A deep neural network then maps\nfrom the latent variable to the observed data space. We considered desirable properties\nofgenerativemodelsandintroducedmetricsthatattempttoquantifytheirperformance.\nNotes\nPopular generative models include generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014),\nvariational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2014), normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed,\nThis work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

To find the distribution q(z|θ) that makes the bound tight, we factor the\nAppendixC.1.3\nnumerator of the log term in the ELBO using the definition of conditional probability:\nConditional\nprobability\nZ (cid:20) (cid:21)\nPr(x,z|ϕ)\nELBO[θ,ϕ] = q(z|θ)log dz\nq(z|θ)\nZ (cid:20) (cid:21)\nPr(z|x,ϕ)Pr(x|ϕ)\n= q(z|θ)log dz\nq(z|θ)\nZ Z (cid:20) (cid:21)\n(cid:2) (cid:3) Pr(z|x,ϕ)\n= q(z|θ)log Pr(x|ϕ) dz+ q(z|θ)log dz\nq(z|θ)\nZ (cid:20) (cid:21)\n(cid:2) (cid:3) Pr(z|x,ϕ)\n= log Pr(x|ϕ) + q(z|θ)log dz\nq(z|θ)\n(cid:2) (cid:3) h (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) i\n= log Pr(x|ϕ) −D q(z|θ)(cid:12)(cid:12)Pr(z|x,ϕ) . (17.17)\nKL\nHere, the first integral disappears between lines three and four since log[Pr(x|ϕ)] does\nAppendixC.5.1 not depend on z, and the integral of the probability distribution q(z|θ) is one. In the\nKLdivergence\nlast line, we have just used the definition of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.\nThis equation shows that the ELBO is the original log-likelihood minus the KL di-\nvergence D [q(z|θ)||Pr(z|x,ϕ)]. The KL divergence measures the “distance” between\nKL\ndistributions and can only take non-negative values. It follows the ELBO is a lower\nbound on log[Pr(x|ϕ)]. The KL distance will be zero, and the bound will be tight\nwhen q(z|θ) = Pr(z|x,ϕ). This is the posterior distribution over the latent variables z\ngiven observed data x; it indicates which values of the latent variable could have been\nresponsible for the data point (figure 17.7).\nThis work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

But then comes the day when we fire a naval cannon at a target twenty kilometers\nto the north of us and all of our shots consistently miss to the east of it because of that\npesky coriolis force – the pseudoforce in the rotating frame of the earth and we learn of\nour mistake.\nWelearntobecautiousinoursystemofbeliefs.

We\nhave to accept the fact that any set of coordinates we might choose might or might not be\ninertial,mightormightnotbe“flat”,thatatbesttheymightbelocally flatandinertialwithin\nthe box we can reach so far.\nIn this latter, highly conservative point of view, how do we determine that the coordi-\nnates we are using are truly inertial? To put it another way, is there a rest frame for the\nUniverse, a Universal inertial frame S from which we can transform to all other frames S ,\n′\ninertial or not?\nThe results of the last section provide us with one possible way. If we systematically\ndetermine the force laws of nature, Newton tells us that all of those laws involve two ob-\njects (at least). I cannot be pushed unless I push back on something. In more appropriate\nlanguage (although not so conceptually profound) all of the force laws are laws of interac-\ntion. I interact with the Earth by means of gravity, and with a knowledge of the force law\nI can compute the force I exert on the Earth and the force the Earth exerts on me given\nonly a knowledge of our mutual relative coordinates in any coordinate system. Later we\nwill learn that the same is more or less true for the electromagnetic interaction – it is a\nlot more complicated, in the end, than gravity, but it is still true that a knowledge of the\ntrajectories of two charged objects suffices to determine their electromagnetic interaction,\nand there is a famous paper by Wheeler and Feynman that suggests that even “radiation\nreaction”(somethingthatlocallyappearsasaone-bodyself-force)isreallyaconsequence\nof interaction with a Universe of charge pairs.\nThis, then, allows us to cleanly differentiate real forces and pseudoforces. Real forces\nalways involve two objects, where pseudoforces have no Newton’s Third Law partner! In\nthe Elevator and Boxcar examples below, real gravity is identified by the fact that while\nthe Earth pulls down on the mass in question, the mass pulls up on the Earth! Where\nthe normal force acts on it, it pushes back on the object exerting the normal force. When\ntension in a string pulls it, it pulls back on the string.\nThere is no Newton’s third law partner to the F~ = m~a pseudoforce arising from\np\n−\nthe acceleration of the frame! Furthermore, this “pseudogravity” behaves differently from\nactual gravity – it is (for example) perfectly uniform within the frame no matter how large\nthe frame might be where actual gravity drops off (however slightly) as one moves verti-\ncally, with the field lines slowly diverging (because the gravitational field diverges from its\nmassive sources).

Thismayexplain\nwhy reducing the batch size and adding noise helps generalization.\nThe above studies consider flatness for a single model and training set. However,\nsharpness alone is not a good criterion to predict generalization between datasets; when\nthe labels in the CIFAR dataset are randomized (making generalization impossible),\nthere is no commensurate sharpening of the minimum (Neyshabur et al., 2017).\n20.4.3 Architecture\nThe inductive bias of a network is determined by its architecture, and judicious choices\nof model can drastically improve generalization. Chapter 10 introduced convolutional\nnetworks, which are designed to process data on regular grids; they implicitly assume\nthat the input statistics are the same across the input, so they share parameters across\nposition. Similarly,transformersaresuitedformodelingdatathatisinvarianttopermu-\ntations, and graph neural networks are suited to data represented on irregular graphs.\nMatching the architecture to the properties of the data improves generalization over\ngeneric, fully connected architectures (see figure 10.8).\n20.4.4 Norm of weights\nSection20.3.4reviewedthefindingofFort&Scherlis(2019)thatthecurvatureoftheloss\nsurfaceisunusuallypositivewhentheℓ normoftheweightslieswithinacertainrange.\n2\nThe same authors provided evidence that generalization is also good when the ℓ weight\n2\nnorm falls within this Goldilocks zone (figure 20.12). This is perhaps unsurprising. The\nnorm of the weights is (indirectly) related to the Lipschitz constant of the model. If this\nnorm is too small, then the model will not be able to change fast enough to capture the\nvariation in the underlying function. If the norm is too large, then the model will be\nunnecessarily variable between training points and will not interpolate smoothly.\nThis finding was used by Liu et al. (2023c) to explain the phenomenon of grokking\n(Power et al., 2022), in which a sudden improvement in generalization can occur many\nepochsafterthetrainingerrorisalreadyzero(figure20.13). Itisproposedthatgrokking\noccurs when the norm of the weights is initially too large; the training data fits well,\nbut the variation of the model between the data points is large. Over time, implicit or\nexplicit regularization decreases the norm of the weights until they reach the Goldilocks\nzone, and generalization suddenly improves.\n20.4.5 Overparameterization\nFigure 8.10 showed that generalization performance tends to improve with the degree\nof overparameterization.

The bottleneck is similar to latent variables in the VAE, but the motivation differs.\nHere, the goal is not to learn a probability distribution but to create a low-dimensional repre-\nsentation that captures the essence of the data. Autoencoders also have various applications,\nincluding denoising (Vincent et al., 2008) and anomaly detection (Zong et al., 2018).\nIftheencoderanddecoderarelineartransformations,theautoencoderisjustprincipalcompo-\nnent analysis (PCA). Hence, the nonlinear autoencoder is a generalization of PCA. There are\nalso probabilistic forms of PCA. Probabilistic PCA (Tipping & Bishop, 1999) adds spherical\nGaussian noise to the reconstruction to create a probability model, and factor analysis adds\ndiagonal Gaussian noise (see Rubin & Thayer, 1982). If we make the encoder and decoder of\nthese probabilistic variants nonlinear, we return to the variational autoencoder.\nArchitecturalvariations: TheconditionalVAE(Sohnetal.,2015)passesclassinformationc\nintoboththeencoderanddecoder. Theresultisthatthelatentspacedoesnotneedtoencode\nthe class information. For example, when MNIST data are conditioned on the digit label, the\nlatentvariablesmightencodetheorientationandwidthofthedigitratherthanthedigitcategory\nitself. Sønderby et al. (2016a) introduced ladder variational autoencoders, which recursively\ncorrect the generative distribution with a data-dependent approximate likelihood term.\nModifyinglikelihood: OtherworkinvestigatesmoresophisticatedlikelihoodmodelsPr(x|z).\nThe PixelVAE (Gulrajani et al., 2016) used an autoregressive model over the output variables.\nDorta et al. (2018) modeled the covariance of the decoder output as well as the mean. Lamb\net al. (2016) improved the quality of reconstruction by adding extra regularization terms that\nencourage the reconstruction to be similar to the original image in the space of activations\nof a layer of an image classification model. This model encourages semantic information to\nbe retained and was used to generate the results in figure 17.13. Larsen et al. (2016) use an\nadversarial loss for reconstruction, which also improves results.\nLatent space, prior, and posterior: Manydifferentformsforthevariationalapproximation\nto the posterior have been investigated, including normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed,\n2015; Kingma et al., 2016), directed graphical models (Maaløe et al., 2016), undirected models\n(Vahdat et al., 2020), and recursive models for temporal data (Gregor et al., 2016, 2019).\nOtherauthorshaveinvestigatedusingadiscretelatentspace(VanDenOordetal.,2017;Razavi\net al., 2019b; Rolfe, 2017; Vahdat et al., 2018a,b).

It is eventually returned by the systemic veins (the supe-\nrior and inferior vena cava) to the right atrium, pumped into the right ventricle\nthrough the one-way tricuspid valve, and then pumped at high pressure into the\npulmonary artery for delivery to the lungs.\nThe human heart (as well as the hearts of birds and mammals in general) is thus\nfour-chambered – two atria and two ventricles. The total resistance of the systemic\ncirculation is generally larger than that of the pulmonary circulation and hence sys-\ntemic arterial blood pressure must be higher than pulmonary arterial blood pressure\nin order to maintain the same flow. The left ventricle (primary systemic pump) is\nthus typically composed of thicker and stronger muscle tissue than the right ven-\ntricle.

This is the peak/maximum arterial pressure in the\nwave pulse generated that drives systemic circulation. It is measured in the\n(brachial artery of the) arm, where it is supposed to be a reasonably accurate\nreflection of peak aortic pressure just outside of the heart, where, sadly, it\ncannot easily be directly measured without resorting to invasive methods that\nare, in fact, used e.g. during surgery.\n– Diastolic bloodpressure.

When the attached mass is pulled out to the right and then held there, it stretches\nboth of the two springs. Here’s an important argument.\nThe total force acting on the mass due to the two springs is F , pulling back to its\nx\nequilibrium position at the end of the two unstretched springs. From N3, that mass is\npulling spring 2 to the right with an equal and opposite force. But spring 2 itself is in\nequilibrium! So spring 1 must be pulling it to the left with force F ! This in turn means\nx\nspring 2 is pulling spring 1 to the right with force F (N3 again) and spring 1 isn’t moving,\nx\nso spring 1 must be pulled to the left by the wall with F , and the wall is pulled to the right\nx\nby F . Newton’s Third Law is useful!\nx\nClever students will recognize this is being very similar to our original arguments for\nwhy the tension in a stationary string is the same throughout the string, pulling any little\ndifferential chunk equally to the right and to the left and ultimately just transferring force\nfrom one end to the other. We’ve simply made a “string” out of our two springs!\nThis gives us a simple insight.

{"instruction": "What are the important aspects covered here?", "input": "", "output": "--- Page 263 ---\n13.4 Graph convolutional networks 249\n13.4.1 Equivariance and invariance\nWe noted before that the indexing of the nodes in the graph is arbitrary, and any\npermutation of the node indices does not change the graph. It is hence imperative that\nany model respects this property. It follows that each layer must be equivariant (see\nsection 10.1) with respect to permutations of the node indices. In other words, if we\npermute the node indices, the node embeddings at each stage will be permuted in the\nsame way. In mathematical terms, if P is a permutation matrix, then we must have:\nH P=F[H P,PTAP,ϕ ]. (13.6)\nk+1 k k\nFor node classification and edge prediction tasks, the output should also be equiv-\nariant with respect to permutations of the node indices. However, for graph-level tasks,\nthe final layer aggregates information from across the graph, so the output is invariant\nProblem13.6\nto the node order. In fact, the output layer from equation 13.2 achieves this because:\ny =sig[β +ω H 1/N]=sig[β +ω H P1/N], (13.7)\nK K K K K K\nfor any permutation matrix P (see problem 13.6).\nThis mirrors the case for images, where segmentation should be equivariant to geo-\nmetric transformations, and image classification should be invariant (figure 10.1). Here,\nconvolutional and pooling layers partially achieve this with respect to translations, but\nthere is no known way to guarantee these properties exactly for more general transfor-\nmations. However, for graphs, it is possible to define networks that ensure equivariance\nor invariance to permutations.\n13.4.2 Parameter sharing\nChapter 10 argued applying fully connected networks to images isn’t sensible because\nthis requires the network to learn how to recognize an object separately at every image\nposition. Instead,weusedconvolutionallayersthatprocessedeverypositionintheimage\nidentically. This reduced the number of parameters and introduced an inductive bias\nthat forced the model to treat every part of the image in the same way.\nThe same argument can be made about nodes in a graph. We could learn a model\nwith separate parameters associated with each node. However, now the network must\nindependently learn the meaning of the connections in the graph at each position, and\ntraining would require many graphs with the same topology. Instead, we build a model\nthat uses the same parameters at every node, reducing the number of parameters and\nsharing what the network learns at each node across the entire graph.\nRecall that a convolution (equation 10.3) updates a variable by taking a weighted\nsum of information from its neighbors. One way to think of this is that each neighbor\nsends a message to the variable of interest, which aggregates these messages to form the\nupdate. When we considered images, the neighbors were pixels from a fixed-size square\nregion around the current position, so the spatial relationships at each position are the\nsame. However, in a graph, each node may have a different number of neighbors, and\nthere are no consistent relationships; there is no sense that we can weight information\nDraft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com."}

{"instruction": "What is Implementing List Prompts?", "input": "", "output": "## Implementing List Prompts\nThe `list_prompts` method is straightforward. It calls the session's list prompts function and returns the prompts:\n```\nasync def list_prompts(self) -> list[types.Prompt]:\n    result = await self.session().list_prompts()\n    return result.prompts\n```\n\n## Getting Individual Prompts\nThe `get_prompt` method is more interesting because it handles variable interpolation. When you request a prompt, you provide arguments that get passed to the prompt function as keyword arguments:\n```\nasync def get_prompt(self, prompt_name, args: dict[str, str]):\n    result = await self.session().get_prompt(prompt_name, args)\n    return result.messages\n```\nFor example, if your server has a `format_document` prompt that expects a `doc_id` parameter, the arguments dictionary would contain `{\"doc_id\": \"plan.md\"}`. This value gets interpolated into the prompt template.\n\n## Testing Prompts in Action\nOnce implemented, you can test prompts through the CLI. When you type a slash (`/`), available prompts appear as commands. Selecting a prompt like `\"format\"` will prompt you to choose from available documents."}

For\nexample, the function y = mlp[x,ϕ] returns a vector y and has vector arguments x\nand ϕ. When a function returns a matrix or tensor, it is written in bold and starts with\na capital letter.

There are three ways to proceed.\nOne is to use simple substitution – manipulate the momentum equation to solve for\n(say) v in terms of v and the givens, substitute it into the energy equation, and then\n2f 1f\nbrute force solve the energy equation for v and back substitute to get v . This involves\n1f 2f\nsolving an annoying quadratic (and a horrendous amount of intermediate algebra) and in\nthe end, gives us no insight at all into the conceptual “physics” of the solution.

Instead of using substitution, then, let’s rearrange\nthe energy conservation equation and momentum conservation equations to get all of the\nterms with a common mass on the same side of the equals signs and do a bit of simple\nmanipulation of the energy equation as well:\nm v2 m v2 = m v2 m v2\n1 1i− 1 1f 2 2f − 2 2i\nm (v2 v2 ) = m (v2 v2)\n1 1i− 1f 2 2f − 2i\nm (v v )(v +v ) = m (v v )(v +v ) (4.72)\n1 1i 1f 1i 1f 2 2f 2i 2i 2f\n− −\n(from energy conservation) and\nm (v v ) = m (v v ) (4.73)\n1 1i 1f 2 2f 2i\n− −\n(from momentum conservation).\nWhen we divide the first of these by the second (subject to the condition that v = v\n1i 1f\n6\nand v = v to avoid dividing by zero, a condition that incidentally guarantees that a\n2i 2f\n6"}

Wethereforeassumethat\nsound waves in air are composed of adiabatic compression of small volumes of the air\n(treated as an ideal gas) by the surrounding air.\nWe pause for a very brief discussion of adiabatic processes for a volume of ideal gas\nwith a constant number of particles. The justification for the starting equation is beyond\nthescopeofthiscoursebutistobefoundinanyintroductoryphysicstextbookthatcovers\nthe thermodynamics of an ideal gas. The relation between pressure and volume in an\nadiabatic compression of an ideal gas is:\nPVγ = A (11.23)\nwhere γ = 5/3 = 1.67 for monoatomic ideal gases and γ = 1.4 for diatomic ideal gases\n(such as air) and A is a constant with the appropriate units.

As a result, the missing data on stress level is not random; it is\ninfluenced by the stress level itself.\nSo, in a way, the higher the stress level, the less likely one will disclose it, and the\nmore likely the value will be missing from the collected dataset. Thus, the\nmissingness is directly dependent on the very variable that is missing in the first\nplace. That’s tricky, isn’t it?\nThere’s not much we can do to address this, except for collecting more\ndata/features. What’s more, domain expertise become extremely important to\nsmartly tackle MNAR and improve the data collection process.\nAt times, I have also preferred proceeding with typical imputation techniques\n(used in MCAR and MAR) because further data collection can be infeasible in\nmost cases. But as discussed above, there is a definite missingness pattern in\nMNAR, which can be important. But direct imputation will discard that\ninformation.\nOne way to retain that missingness pattern is by adding a binary feature,\nindicating whether the feature was imputed.\nThis way, the ML algorithm can still access and learn the missing data patterns.\n395"}

They\nargue that current models for large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) aren’t overparameterized\nenough; increasing model capacity further may be key to improving performance.\n20.6 Do networks have to be deep?\nChapter 3 discussed the universal approximation theorem. This states that shallow\nneuralnetworkscanapproximateanyfunctiontoarbitraryaccuracygivenenoughhidden\nunits. This raises the obvious question of whether networks need to be deep.\nFirst, let’s consider the evidence that depth is required. Historically, there has been\nadefinitecorrelationbetweenperformanceanddepth. Forexample, performanceonthe\nImageNet benchmark initially improved as a function of network depth until training\nbecame diﬀicult. Subsequently, residual connections and batch normalization (chap-\nter 11) allowed training of deeper networks with commensurate gains in performance.\nAtthetimeofwriting,almostallstate-of-the-artapplications,includingimageclassifica-\ntion (e.g., the vision transformer), text generation (e.g., GPT3), and text-guided image\nsynthesis (e.g., DALL·E-2), are based on deep networks with tens or hundreds of layers.\nDespite this trend, there have been efforts to use shallower networks. Zagoruyko &\nKomodakis(2016)constructedshallowerbutwiderresidualneuralnetworksandachieved\nsimilarperformancetoResNet. Morerecently,Goyaletal.(2021)constructedanetwork\nthatusedparallelconvolutionalchannelsandachievedperformancesimilartodeepernet-\nworkswithonly12layers. Furthermore,Veitetal.(2016)showedthatitispredominantly\nshorter paths of 5–17 layers that drive performance in residual networks.\nNonetheless,thebalanceofevidencesuggeststhatdepthiscritical; eventheshallow-\nest networks with good image classification performance require >10 layers. However,\nthere is no definitive explanation for why. Three possible explanations are that (i) deep\nnetworks can represent more complex functions than shallow ones, (ii) deep networks\nare easier to train, and (iii) deep networks impose better inductive biases.\n20.6.1 Complexity of modeled function\nChapter4showedthatdeepnetworksmakefunctionswithmanymorelinearregionsthan\nshallow ones for the same parameter count. We also saw that “pathological” functions\nhavebeenidentifiedthatrequireexponentiallymorehiddenunitstomodelwithashallow\nnetworkthanadeepone(e.g.,Eldan&Shamir,2016;Telgarsky,2016). IndeedLiang&\nSrikant(2016)foundquitegeneralfamiliesoffunctionsthataremoreeﬀicientlymodeled\nby deep networks. However, Nye & Saxe (2018) found that some of these functions\ncannot easily be fit by deep networks in practice.

Steel is pretty hard, but with enough force we can bend “solid” steel, we can\nstretch or compress it, we can turn it into a spring, we can fracture it. Bone is also pretty\nhard and it does exactly the same thing: bend, stretch, compress, fracture. The physics\nof bending, stretching, compressing, and fracturing a solid object is associated with the\napplicationofaquantitycalledstress (withunitsofpressure,notewell,butnotprecisely a\npressure) to the object. Let’s see how.\n9.6.3: A Microscopic Picture of a Solid\nLet us consider a solid piece of some simple material. If we look at pure elemental solids\n– for example metals – we often find that when they form a solid the atoms arrange them-\nselves into a regular lattice that is “close packed” – arranged so that the atoms more or\nless touch each other with a minimum of wasted volume. There are a number of kinds of\nlattices that appear (determined by the subtleties of the quantum mechanical interactions\nbetween the atoms and hence beyond the scope of this course) but in many cases the\nlattice is a variant of the cubic lattice where there are atoms on the corners of a regular\ncartesian grid in three dimensions (and sometimes additional atoms in the center of the\ncubes or on the faces of the cubes).\nNot all materials are so regular. Materials can be made out of a mixture of atoms, out\nof molecules made of a mixture of atoms, out of a mixture of molecules, or even out of\nliving cells made out of a mixture of molecules. The resulting materials can be ordered,\nstructured (not exactly the same thing as ordered, especially in the case of solids formed\nby life processes such as bone or coral), or disordered (amorphous).\nAs usual, we will deal with all of this complexity by ignoring most of it for now and\nconsideringan“ideal”casewhereasinglekindofatomslinedupinaregularsimplecubic\nlattice is sufficient to help us understand properties that will hold, with different values of\ncourse, even for amorphous or structured solids. This is illustrated in figure 135, which\nis basically a mental cartoon model for a generic solid – lots of atoms in a regular cubic\nlattice with a cube side a, where the interactomic forces that hold each atom in position is\nrepresented by a spring, a concept that is valid as long as we don’t compress or stretch\nthese interatomic “bonds” by too much.\nWeneedtoquantifythenumbersofatomsandbondsinawaythathelpsusunderstand"}

{"instruction": "What are the key points about this topic?", "input": "", "output": "--- Page 248 ---\n234 12 Transformers\nhancementstotransformersdonotmakemeaningfulperformanceimprovementswhencarefully\nassessed in controlled experiments (Narang et al., 2021).\nApplications: Models based on self-attention and/or the transformer architecture have been\napplied to text sequences (Vaswani et al., 2017), image patches (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021),\nprotein sequences (Rives et al., 2021), graphs (Veličković et al., 2019), database schema (Xu\net al., 2021b), speech (Wang et al., 2020c), mathematical integration when formulated as a\ntranslation problem (Lample & Charton, 2020), and time series (Wu et al., 2020b). However,\ntheirmostcelebratedsuccesseshavebeeninbuildinglanguagemodelsand,morerecently,asa\nreplacement for convolutional networks in computer vision.\nLarge language models: Vaswani et al. (2017) targeted translation tasks, but transformers\narenowmoreusuallyusedtobuildeitherpureencoderorpuredecodermodels,themostfamous\nof which are BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT2/GPT3 (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\n2020), respectively. These models are usually tested against benchmarks like GLUE (Wang\net al., 2019b), which includes the SQuAD question-answering task (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)\ndescribedinsection12.6.2,SuperGLUE(Wangetal.,2019a)andBIG-bench(Srivastavaetal.,\n2022), which combine many NLP tasks to create an aggregate score for measuring language\nability. Decodermodelsaregenerallynotfine-tunedforthesetasksbutcanperformwellanyway\nwhen given a few examples of questions and answers and asked to complete the text from the\nnext question. This is referred to as few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020).\nSince GPT3, many decoder language models have been released with steady improvement in\nfew-shot results. These include GLaM (Du et al., 2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla\n(Hoffmann et al., 2023), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022), and LaMDa (Thoppilan\net al., 2022). Most of the performance improvement is attributable to increased model size,\nusing sparsely activated modules, and exploiting larger datasets. At the time of writing, the\nmost recent model is PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which has 540 billion parameters and\nwas trained on 780 billion tokens across 6144 processors. Interestingly, since text is highly\ncompressible,thismodelhasmorethanenoughcapacitytomemorizetheentiretrainingdataset.\nThisistrueformanylanguagemodels. Manyboldstatementshavebeenmadeabouthowlarge\nlanguage models exceed human performance. This is probably true for some tasks, but such\nstatementsshouldbetreatedwithcaution(seeRibeiroetal.,2021;McCoyetal.,2019;Bowman\n& Dahl, 2021; and Dehghani et al., 2021).\nThese models have considerable world knowledge. For example, in section 12.7.4, the model\nknows key facts about deep learning, including that it is a type of machine learning with\nassociated algorithms and applications. Indeed, one such model has been mistakenly identified\nas being sentient (Clark, 2022). However, there are persuasive arguments that the degree of\n“understanding” this type of model can ever have is limited (Bender & Koller, 2020).\nTokenizers: Schuster & Nakajima (2012) and Sennrich et al. (2015) introduced WordPiece\nandbyte pair encoding(BPE),respectively. Bothmethodsgreedilymergepairsoftokensbased\non their frequency of adjacency (figure 12.8), with the main difference being how the initial\ntokens are chosen. For example, in BPE, the initial tokens are characters or punctuation with\na special token to denote whitespace. The merges cannot occur over the whitespace. As the\nalgorithm proceeds, new tokens are formed by combining characters recursively so that sub-\nword and word tokens emerge. The unigram language model (Kudo, 2018) generates several\npossiblecandidatemergesandchoosesthebestonebasedonthelikelihoodinalanguagemodel.\nProvilkov et al. (2020) develop BPE dropout, which generates the candidates more eﬀiciently\nbyintroducingrandomnessintotheprocessofcountingfrequencies. Versionsofbothbytepair\nencoding and the unigram language model are included in the SentencePiece library (Kudo &\nRichardson,2018),whichworksdirectlyonUnicodecharactersandcanworkwithanylanguage.\nHeetal.(2020)introduceamethodthattreatsthesub-wordsegmentationasalatentvariable\nthat should be marginalized out for learning and inference.\nThis work is subject to a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.

Thetesterrordoesshowthetypicalbias-variancetrade-off\nas we increase the capacity to the point where the model fits the training data exactly.\nHowever, then it does something unexpected; it starts to decrease again. Indeed, if we\nadd enough capacity, the test loss reduces to below the minimal level that we achieved\nin the first part of the curve.\nThis phenomenon is known as double descent. For some datasets like MNIST, it is\npresentwiththeoriginaldata(figure8.10c). Forothers,likeMNIST-1DandCIFAR-100\n(figure 8.10d), it emerges or becomes more prominent when we add noise to the labels.\nNotebook8.3\nThe first part of the curve is referred to as the classical or under-parameterized regime,\nDoubledescent\nandthesecondpartasthemodernorover-parameterizedregime. Thecentralpartwhere\nthe error increases is termed the critical regime.\n8.4.1 Explanation\nThediscoveryofdoubledescentisrecent,unexpected,andsomewhatpuzzling. Itresults\nfromaninteractionoftwophenomena. First, thetestperformancebecomestemporarily\nworse when the model has just enough capacity to memorize the data. Second, the test\nperformancecontinuestoimprovewithcapacityevenwhenthisexceedsthepointwhere\nthetrainingdataareallclassifiedcorrectly. Thefirstphenomenonisexactlyaspredicted\nby the bias-variance trade-off. The second phenomenon is more confusing; it’s unclear\nwhyperformanceshouldbebetterintheover-parameterizedregime,giventhatthereare\nnow not even enough training data points to constrain the model parameters uniquely.\nTo understand why performance continues to improve as we add more parameters,\nnote that once the model has enough capacity to drive the training loss to near zero,\nthe model fits the training data almost perfectly. This implies that further capacity\nProblems8.4–8.5\ncannot help the model fit the training data any better; any change must occur between\nthe training points. The tendency of a model to prioritize one solution over another\nbetween data points is known as its inductive bias.\nThe model’s behavior between data points is critical because, in high-dimensional\nspace,thetrainingdataareextremelysparse. TheMNIST-1Ddatasethas40dimensions,\nand we trained with 10,000 examples. If this seems like plenty of data, consider what\nwould happen if we quantized each input dimension into 10 bins. There would be 1040\nbins in total, constrained by only 104 examples. Even with this coarse quantization,\nthere will only be one data point in every 1036 bins! The tendency of the volume of\nhigh-dimensional space to overwhelm the number of training points is termed the curse\nof dimensionality.\nTheimplicationisthatproblemsinhighdimensionsmightlookmorelikefigure8.11a;\nthere are small regions of the input space where we observe data with significant gaps\nbetween them. The putative explanation for double descent is that as we add capacity\nto the model, it interpolates between the nearest data points increasingly smoothly. In\nthe absence of information about what happens between the training points, assuming\nsmoothness is sensible and will probably generalize reasonably to new data.\nDraft: please send errata to udlbookmail@gmail.com."}

The scale ρ of the proposal distribution should be as large as possible\nwithout incurring high rejection rates. This suggests that ρ should be of the same\norder as the smallest length scale σ min. The system then explores the distribution\nalong the more extended direction by means of a random walk, and so the number\nof steps to arrive at a state that is more or less independent of the original state is\noforder(σ\nmax\n/σ\nmin\n)2.

A second ReLU function was applied after this\nblock was added back to the main representation. This architecture was termed ResNet v1.\nHe et al. (2016b) investigated different variations of residual architectures, in which either (i)\nprocessing could also be applied along the skip connection or (ii) after the two branches had\nrecombined. They concluded neither was necessary, leading to the architecture in figure 11.7,\nwhich is sometimes termed a pre-activation residual block and is the backbone of ResNet v2.\nThey trained a network with 200 layers that improved further on the ImageNet classification\ntask (see figure 11.8). Since this time, new methods for regularization, optimization, and data\naugmentationhavebeendeveloped,andWightmanetal.(2021)exploitthesetopresentamore\nmodern training pipeline for the ResNet architecture.\nWhy residual connections help: Residual networks certainly allow deeper networks to be\ntrained. Presumably, this is related to reducing shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017) at\nthe start of training and the smoother loss surface near the minima as depicted in figure 11.13\n(Li et al., 2018b). Residual connections alone (i.e., without batch normalization) increase the\ntrainabledepthofanetworkbyroughlyafactoroftwo(Sankararamanetal.,2020). Withbatch\nnormalization, very deep networks can be trained, but it is unclear that depth is critical for\nperformance. Zagoruyko&Komodakis(2016)showedthatwideresidualnetworkswithonly16\nlayers outperformed all residual networks of the time for image classification. Orhan & Pitkow\n(2017) propose a different explanation for why residual connections improve learning in terms\nof eliminating singularities (places on the loss surface where the Hessian is degenerate).\nRelated architectures: Residualconnectionsareaspecialcaseofhighway networks(Srivas-\ntavaetal.,2015)whichalsosplitthecomputationintotwobranchesandadditivelyrecombine.\nHighway networks use a gating function that weights the inputs to the two branches in a way\nthatdependsonthedataitself,whereasresidualnetworkssendthedatadownbothbranchesin\nastraightforwardmanner. Xieetal.(2017)introducedtheResNeXtarchitecture,whichplaces\na residual connection around multiple parallel convolutional branches.\nResidual networks as ensembles: Veit et al. (2016) characterized residual networks as en-\nsemblesofshorternetworksanddepictedthe“unravelednetwork”interpretation(figure11.4b).\nThey provide evidence that this interpretation is valid by showing that deleting layers in a\ntrained network (and hence a subset of paths) only has a modest effect on performance. Con-\nversely, removing a layer in a purely sequential network like VGG is catastrophic. They also\nlookedatthegradientmagnitudesalongpathsofdifferentlengthsandshowedthatthegradient\nvanishesinlongerpaths. Inaresidualnetworkconsistingof54blocks,almostallofthegradient\nupdates during training were from paths of length 5 to 17 blocks long, even though these only\nconstitute 0.45% of the total paths. It seems that adding more blocks effectively adds more\nparallel shorter paths rather than creating a network that is truly deeper.\nRegularization for residual networks: L2regularizationoftheweightshasafundamentally\ndifferenteffectinvanillanetworksandresidualnetworkswithoutBatchNorm. Intheformer,it\nencourages the output of the layer to be a constant function determined by the biases. In the\nlatter, it encourages the residual block to compute the identity plus a constant determined by\nthe biases.\nSeveral regularization methods have been developed that are targeted specifically at residual\narchitectures.

It follows from this argument that the\nmean µ control the position of the center of the bell curve, and the square root σ of the\nvariance (the standard deviation) controls the width of the bell curve.\nC.3.2 Multivariate normal distribution\nThe multivariate normal distribution generalizes the normal distribution to describe the\nprobability over a vector quantity x of length D. It is defined by a D×1 mean vector µ\nand a symmetric positive definite D×D covariance matrix Σ:\n(cid:20) (cid:21)\n1 (x−µ)TΣ −1(x−µ)\nNorm [µ,Σ]= exp − .

Data augmentations\nFor data augmentations T and T , we use SimCLR augmentations: random crop, horizontal flip, color jitter, and grayscale.\noe\nWe simply set T =T in all our experiments. The details for the augmentations are:\noe\n• Random crop. We randomly crops of the original image with uniform distribution from a to 1.0. We select a=0.5 for\nRaabin-WBC dataset and Ham10000 dataset, and all the other datasets we set a=0.08. After cropping, cropped image\nare resized to match the original image size.\n• Horizontal flip. All training images are randomly horizontally flipped with 50% of probability.\n• Color jitter. Color jitter changes the brightness, contrast, saturation and hue of images. We implement color jitter using\npytorch’s color jitter function with brightness = 0.4,contrast = 0.4,saturation = 0.4 and hue = 0.1. The probability to\napply color jitter to a training image is set at 80%.\n• Grayscale. Convert an image to grayscale with 20% of probability.\nK.

For the experiment of HSC with 1-sample CIFAR100 as OE, we\ntrain it for 200 epochs with milestones at 100 and 150 epochs instead of 30 epochs. So it have same training ground with\nexperiments using SVHN and DTD as OE datasets. For BCE-CLIP configurations on Table IV, we train it for 40 epochs with\nlearning rate reduced by a factor of 10 at milestone 35.\n2) GT and GT+: We use the official implementations from [18].

{"instruction": "Explain the concept discussed in this section.", "input": "", "output": "- Embeddings: Numerical representations of tokens. Each token is assigned a vector that captures meaning and relationships with other tokens.\n- Vectors: A list of numbers. Learned during the training process and allow the model to understand the context and nuances of language.\n\t- For example, the embedding vector for the token \"cat\" might be close to the vectors for \"feline\" and \"kitten\" in the embedding space, indicating that they are semantically related. This way, the model can understand that \"cat\" is similar to \"feline\" and \"kitten\" without being explicitly programmed with those relationships.\n- You can see an illustration of this example below:\n\n##### Diffusion Models\n- Diffusion: Deep learning architecture system that starts with pure noise or random data. The models gradually add more and more meaningful information to this noise until they end up with a clear, coherent output, like text or music. \n\t- Learns through a two-step process of forward diffusion and reverse diffusion.\n\t\t- Forward diffusion: System gradually introduces a small amount of noise to an input image until only the noise is left over.\n\t\t\t- \n\t\t- Reverse diffusion: Noisy image is gradually introduced to de-noising until a new image is generated.\n\t\t- \n\t- Diffusion models can be applied to more than just image generation.\n##### Multimodal Models \n- Multimodal models: Can process and generate multiple modes of data simultaneously.\n\t- Can be used for:\n\t\t- Automating video captioning\n\t\t- Creating graphics from text instructions\n\t\t- Answering questions intelligently\n\t\t- Translating content with relevant visuals\n### Other Generative Models\n- Several types of generative models used in ML and AI. You can learn more about these models in the sections below.\n### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n- Type of generative model involving 2 neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. \n\t- The two networks are a generator and a discriminator.\n#### Generator\n- Generates new synthetic data by taking random noise and transforming it into data similar to what it was trained on.\n#### Discriminator\n- Takes real data from the training set and synthetic data generated by the generator as input. Goal is to distinguish between the real and generated data.\n#### Training GANs\n- Generator tries to generate data that can fool the discriminator into thinking it's real, while the discriminator tries to classify real and generated data.\n- Adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is indistinguishable from real data.\n#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\n- Type of generative model that combines ideas from autoencoders (a type of neural network) and variational inference (a technique from Bayesian statistics).\n- Consists of 2 parts:\n\t- Encoder: Neural network that takes the input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional latent space, which captures the essential features of the data.\n\t- Decoder: Neural network that takes the latent representation from the encoder and generates a reconstruction of the original input data.\n##### Note About VAEs\n- Latent space is encouraged to follow a specific probability distribution (usually a Gaussian distribution), which allows for generating new data by sampling from the latent space and passing the samples through the decoder.\n## Optimizing Model Outputs\n- Optimization is an important part of the FM lifecycle. \n- Techniques for optimization vary in complexity and cost.\n- Prompt engineering = lowest cost\n### Prompt Engineering\n- Prompts = instructions to the FM\n- Prompt engineering: Developing, designing, optimizing prompts to enhance FM outputs. Guides model's behavior to meet your needs.\n- Prompts can involve the following elements:\n\t- Instructions\n\t- Context\n\t- Input data\n\t- Output indicator (type or format)\n### Fine-Tuning\nFMs are pre-trained through self-supervised learning and can inherently understand information.\nDespite this, fine-tuning can still improve performance.\n- Fine-tuning: Supervised learning process that involves taking a pre-trained model and adding specific, smaller datasets. \n\t- Adding these narrower datasets modifies the weights of the data to better align with the task. \n\t- Two ways to fine-tune a model:\n\t\t- Instruction fine-tuning: Examples of how the model should respond to a specific instruction. A type of instruction fine-tuning is prompt tuning.\n\t\t- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Provides human feedback data, resulting in a model that is better aligned with human preferences.\n### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Technique that supplies domain-relevant data as context to produce responses based on that data. Similar to fine-tuning, but instead of having to fine-tune an FM with a small set of labeled examples, RAG retrieves a small set of relevant documents and uses that to provide context to answer the user prompt.\n- Does not change the weights of the foundation model, whereas fine-tuning changes model weights.\n## AWS Infrastructure and Technologies\n- AWS AI/ML Services Stack:\n\t- ML Frameworks\n\t\t- Amazon SageMaker: Fully-managed ML service that allows you to build and deploy your own custom models.

Not all functions\nhaveauniqueinversefunction,asweshallsee,butmostofthemhaveaninversefunction\nthat we can use with some restrictions to solve problems.\nGiven a function f(x), if every value in the range of f corresponds to one and only\none value in its domain x, then f−1 = x(f) is also a function, called the inverse of f.\nWhen this condition is satisfied, the range of f(x) is the domain of x(f) and vice versa.\nIn terms of composition:\nx =x(f(x )) (45)\n0 0\nand\nf =f(x(f )) (46)\n0 0\nforanyx inthedomainoff(x)andf intherangeoff(x)arebothtrue;thecomposition\n0 0\nof f and the inverse function for some value f yields f again and is hence an “identity”\n0 0\noperation on the range of f(x).\nMany functions do not have a unique inverse, however. For example, the function:\nf(x)=cos(x) (47)\ndoes not. If we look for values x in the domain of this function such that f(x ) = 1,\nm m\nwe find an infinite number:\nx =2πm (48)\nm\nfor m = 0, 1, 2, 3...

In\nmany problems they will effectively be one dimensional, but in some they will not\nand you must establish e.g. the torque equilibrium condition for several different\ndirections.\nA common question that arises in statics is the tipping problem. For an object\n•\nplacedonaslopeorpivotedinsomewaysuchthatgravityopposedbynormalforces\nprovidesoneofthesourcesoftorquethattendstokeeptheobjectstable,whilesome\nvariable force provides a torque that tends to tip the object over the pivot, one uses\nthe condition of marginal static equilibrium to determine, e.g. the lowest value of the\nvariable force that will tip the object over.\nA force couple is defined to be a pair of forces that are equal and opposite but that\n•\ndo not necessarily or generally act along the same line upon an object. The\npoint of this definition is that it is easily to see that force couples exert no net force\non an object but they will exert a net torque on the object as long as they do not\nact along the same line. Furthermore:\nThe vector torque exerted on a rigid object by a force couple is the same for all\n•\nchoices of pivot! This (and the frequency with which they occur in problems) is the\nbasis for the definition.\nAs you can see, this is a short week, just perfectto share with the midtermhour exam.\n365"}

The core philosophy, first introduced by WinCLIP [31], is to formulate\nanomaly detection as a two-class classification problem within the multimodal em-\nbedding space. Specifically, a pair of text tokens are constructed: un representing\nt\nthe normal state, and ua representing the abnormal state. Given an image X\nt\nwith visual embeddings u and the corresponding text embeddings un,ua ,\n{ v } { t t}\nthe anomaly score for each patch is computed via a softmax comparison:\nexp( u ,ua /τ)\ns = ⟨ v t⟩ ,\na exp( u ,ua /τ)+exp( u ,un /τ)\nv t v t\n⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩\nwhere τ is the temperature hyperparameter. This probabilistic formulation quan-\ntifies how strongly each patch aligns with the notion of “abnormality” relative to\n“normality,” which CLIP implicitly learns through large-scale pretraining.\n14"}

Notable\nsubsequent winners of this challenge include the network-in-network architecture (Lin et al.,\n2014), which alternated convolutions with fully connected layers that operated independently\non all of the channels at each position (i.e., 1×1 convolutions). Zeiler & Fergus (2014) and\nSimonyan&Zisserman(2014)trainedlargeranddeeperarchitecturesthatwerefundamentally\nsimilar to AlexNet. Szegedy et al. (2017) developed an architecture called GoogLeNet, which\nintroduced inception blocks. These use several parallel paths with different filter sizes, which\nare then recombined. This effectively allowed the system to learn the filter size.\nThetrendwasforperformancetoimprovewithincreasingdepth. However,itultimatelybecame\ndiﬀicult to train deeper networks without modifications; these include residual connections\nand normalization layers, both of which are described in the next chapter. Progress in the\nImageNet challenges is summarized in Russakovsky et al. (2015). A more general survey of\nimage classification using convolutional networks can be found in Rawat & Wang (2017). The\nimprovement of image classification networks over time is visualized in figure 10.21.\nTypes of convolutional layers: Atrous or dilated convolutions were introduced by Chen\netal.(2018c)andYu&Koltun(2015).

For\nakernelsizeofK×K withC inputchannelsandC outputchannels,thisrequiresK×K×C\nparameters rather than the K ×K ×C ×C parameters in a regular convolutional layer. A\nrelated approach is grouped convolutions (Xie et al., 2017), where each convolution kernel is\nonly applied to a subset of the channels with a commensurate reduction in the parameters. In\nfact, groupedconvolutionswereusedinAlexNetforcomputationalreasons; thewholenetwork\ncould not run on a single GPU, so some channels were processed on one GPU and some on\nanother, with limited interaction points. Separable convolutions treat each kernel as an outer\nproduct of 1D vectors; they use C +K +K parameters for each of the C channels. Partial\nconvolutions (Liu et al., 2018a) are used when inpainting missing pixels and account for the\npartial masking of the input. Gated convolutions learn the mask from the previous layer (Yu\net al., 2019; Chang et al., 2019b). Hu et al.

There is no direct network connection (wired or wireless) between the air-gapped system and any other network.  \n* **Purpose:** The primary goal is to prevent unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or remote compromise by network-based attacks (like malware spreading over the network, hacking attempts, or supply chain attacks via network connections).  \n* **Implementation:** This means dedicated physical hardware (computers, servers) located in a secure facility, with no network cables running to other networks, and no wireless access points nearby. Network interfaces might be physically disabled or disconnected.  \n  \n2. **Highly Secured:**  \n_**Meaning:** This refers to layers of security applied_ beyond* just physical isolation. It's not just air-gapped; it's designed with multiple, robust security controls.  \n* **Components:**  \n* **Secure Facility:** The physical location housing the air-gapped systems must be highly secure (e.g., restricted access, biometric controls, surveillance, tamper-evident seals).  \n* **Secure Personnel:** Individuals working with or accessing the systems must undergo rigorous vetting, background checks, and security clearance. They must be trained in security protocols.  \n* **Strict Access Controls:** Access to the physical systems and data should be minimal and strictly controlled. This often involves physical keys, smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Need-to-know basis is critical.  \n* **Secure Development/Operations:** The process of building and maintaining the software/system (the \"train\") itself must be secure. This includes secure coding practices, code signing, sandboxing, and potentially dedicated, isolated development environments that are themselves air-gapped.  \n_**Data Protection:** Even within the air-gapped environment, data must be protected (encryption at rest and potentially in transit_ within* the facility if necessary), and data transfer in/out must be strictly controlled and audited. Data minimization principles should be applied.  \n* **Threat Modeling & Penetration Testing:** Regular, intensive threat modeling and penetration testing (both physical and logical) are essential to identify weaknesses.  \n* **Incident Response Plan:** A detailed plan must be in place for responding to security breaches or compromises.  \n  \n3. **Train Model (Interpretation):**  \n* This part is a bit trickier. It could mean:  \n* **The process itself:** The \"train\" is the entire lifecycle process (development, testing, deployment, maintenance) for a critical system, executed with extreme security measures. Think of it as a defined, secure methodology.  \n* **The software/system:** The critical software or system being developed/maintained is the \"train,\" and it operates within this highly secured, air-gapped environment.  \n  \n## In Summary  \n  \nA \"highly secured air-gapped train model\" refers to a **comprehensive approach** to developing, maintaining, and operating critical systems/software.  \n  \n* It **starts with** strict physical isolation (air-gapping) to prevent network-based attacks.  \n* It **adds layers upon layers** of physical security, procedural security, personnel vetting, strict access controls, secure development practices, and continuous monitoring/testing.  \n* It aims to create an environment with one of the highest barriers to unauthorized access or compromise, typically used for protecting national security secrets, critical infrastructure control systems (like power grids, nuclear facilities), or highly sensitive financial systems.  \n  \nThink of it as building a fortress that is not just walled off from the internet, but also heavily guarded, electronically shielded, and with strict rules for everyone entering or interacting with it.\n### Model Control\n- Controllable model: You can influence model's predictions and behavior by changing aspects of training data.\n\t- Higher controllability = more transparency into the model; corrects biases\n\t- Measured by how much control you have over the model by changing input data\n\t\t- More controllable models are easier to steer\n\t\t\t- Important to fairness\n\t\t\t- Important to debugging/transparency\n\t- Depends on model architecture\n\t\t- Linear models = more controllable\n\t\t- Complex models = less controllable\n\t- Test controllability by evaluating if manipulating data (adding or removing examples) causes expected changes \n\t\t- Improved through data augmentation techniques and by adding constraints to the training process.\n## Principles of Human-Centered Design for Explainable AI\n- Human-centered design (HCD): Approach in creating products and services that are intuitive, easy to use, and meet human needs. \n\t- Applied to explainable AI --> Ensures explanations are clear and useful (accurate and fair, too)\n\t- Key principles:\n\t\t- Design for amplified decision-making\n\t\t- Design for unbiased decision-making\n\t\t- Design for human/AI learning\n### Design for Amplified Decision Making\n- Supports decision making in high-stakes situations\n- Maximizes benefits of using tech, while iminimizing risks and errors\n\t- Especially when humans have to make high-stress decisions in pressure-driven envs.\n\t- Leads to better outcomes for society\n### Key Aspects\n- Clarity: Info is easy to read/interpret.

In AI learning, AI models learn from human instructors.\n- Personalization: Tailor-making learning experiences and tools to meet needs of learners. Uses data analytics and ML algos to adapt to learning styles.\n- User-centered Design: Designing learning environments/tools that are intuitive to learners.

The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net-\nwork of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back-\npropagation used to evaluate first derivatives, which shares many of its desirable\nfeaturesincludingcomputationalefficiency(Bishop,1991;Bishop,1992). Itcanbe\napplied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of\nthenetworkoutputsandtonetworkshavingarbitrarydifferentiableactivationfunc-\ntions.

Section 6.1 describes the motivation and\nprovides an overview of this preliminary bridging framework. Section 6.2 presents\nthe generation of pseudo-masks from batch-based anomaly scores using statistical\nmodeling and adaptive thresholding. Section 6.3 reports experimental results,\nincluding the setup and limitations of this proof-of-concept approach.\n6.1 Motivation and Overview\nAlthough they arise from distinct philosophies, both batch-based and text-based\nzero-shot methods pursue the same ultimate goal: detecting anomalies without\nhuman supervision. Batch-based methods exploit the overwhelming prevalence of\nnormal patterns in a batch, achieving high robustness and accuracy through cross-\nsample consistency. However, they require large batches, substantial memory, and\nexpensive computation.

Sure this is tough to manage at college – there are\nnoparentstotellyoutogotobed,lotsofthingstodo,andofcourseyou’reinclassduring\nthe day and then you study, so late night is when you have fun. Unfortunately, learning is\nclearly correlated with engagement, activity, and mental alertness, and all of these tend to\nshut down when you’re tired. Furthermore, the formation of long term memory of any kind\nfromaday’sexperienceshasbeenshowninbothanimalandhumanstudiestodependon\nthebrainundergoingatleastafewnaturalsleepcyclesofdeepsleepalternatingwithREM\n(Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, dreaming sleep. Rats taught a maze and then deprived of\nREM sleep cannot run the maze well the next day; rats that are taught the same maze\nbut that get a good night’s worth of rat sleep with plenty of rat dreaming can run the maze\nwell the next day. People conked on the head who remain unconscious for hours and are\nthereby deprived of normal sleep often have permanent amnesia of the previous day – it\nnever gets turned into long term memory.\nThis is hardly surprising. Pure common sense and experience tell you that your brain\nwon’t work too well if it is hungry and tired. Common sense (and yes, experience) will\nrapidly convince you that learning generally works better if you’re not stoned or drunk\nwhen you study. Learning works much better when you have time to learn and haven’t put\neverything off to the last minute. In fact, all of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs5 are important\nparameters that contribute to the probability of success in learning.\nThereisonemoresetofveryimportantvariablesthatstronglyaffectourabilitytolearn,\nand they are in some ways the least well understood. These are variables that describe\nyou as an individual, that describe your particular brain and how it works. Pretty much\neverybody will learn better if they are self-actualized and fully and actively engaged, if the\nmaterial they are trying to learn is available in a form that makes sense and clearly com-\nmunicates the implicit patterns that enable efficient information compression and storage,\nandabovealliftheycareaboutwhattheyarestudyingandlearning,ifithasvaluetothem.\nBut everybody is not the same, and the optimal learning strategy for one person is\nnot going to be what works well, or even at all, for another.

Some students do improve, even dramatically improve – when\nthisorthatteaching/learningmethodologyisintroduced. Inothersthereisnochange. Still\nothers actually do worse. In the end, the beneficial effect to a selected subgroup of the\nstudents may be lost in the statistical noise of the study and the fact that no attempt is\nmade to identify commonalities among students that succeed or fail.\nThe point is that finding an optimal teaching and learning strategy is technically an op-\ntimization problem on a high dimensional space.
